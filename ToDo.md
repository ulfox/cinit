## ToDo

### Features

- Perssistent Storage
- Switch HTTP & UDS with GRPC
- Read services from env
  - Example: parse CINIT_SOMENAME: b64String
- Get CGroup Info
- Set Channel Timeouts via flags
- Channel Sync
  - Example: module for handling inter channel communication and ensuring the channel closes without errors (write on closed channel)
- Service contracts module: Cinitd should know the service status internally and not fetch it on request

### Improvements

TBD

### Bugs

Probably many (we will add bugs that we spot here)
